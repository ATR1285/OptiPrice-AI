# OptiPrice AI: Intelligent Dynamic Pricing System

OptiPrice AI is an advanced AI-powered dynamic pricing system designed to optimize pricing strategies using machine learning algorithms and Q-learning-based reinforcement learning techniques. This project predicts optimal product prices in real-time based on various factors such as demand levels, customer behavior, and market trends.

## Features

- **Real-Time Price Prediction:** Predicts the best price for a product based on demand and market trends.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Utilizes Q-learning to optimize pricing based on real-time feedback and rewards.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Automatically adjusts product prices based on changing demand levels.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Provides insights into how pricing strategies can influence demand and revenue.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:** The system ingests historical sales data, including information about products, prices, and demand levels.
2. **Model Training:** The AI model is trained using Q-learning, where it learns the optimal price action for different demand levels to maximize revenue.
3. **Prediction & Optimization:** After training, the model predicts the optimal price for each product in real-time and updates prices dynamically based on changing market conditions.
4. **User Interaction:** The system provides an intuitive interface where businesses can easily monitor pricing strategies and make manual adjustments if needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language used for model development and data processing.
- **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization tools.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library used for model building.
- **Q-learning:** Reinforcement learning algorithm for dynamic pricing.
- **Google Colab:** Cloud-based platform for executing code and model training.

## Installation

To get started with OptiPrice AI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OptiPrice-AI.git
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the project:
   Open the Jupyter notebook (`OptiPrice_Ai_Implementation.ipynb`) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, and follow the steps outlined in the code.

## Usage

Once the model is set up, you can provide new product data (such as current demand level, product ID, etc.) to predict the optimal price. The system will use the trained Q-learning model to recommend the best price for the product.
